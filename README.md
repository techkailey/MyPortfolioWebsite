PortfolioWebsite

DESCRIPTION
- Portfolio website to track my work and accomplishments.
- During the process of creating this website, I learned three different languages.
- I learned: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. These three languages helped me build and create my website. On my website, I have five different sections:
Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact.
